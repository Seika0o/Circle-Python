To run the code, you need to have the Pygame library installed.
You can install Pygame using pip, the package installer for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

-pip install pygame

This will download and install the Pygame library on your system.
Once the installation is complete, you can run the Python code that tracks the user's mouse and calculates the perfection of the drawn circle.
